## Luiz Max Carvalho

Hi there,

I am a Lecturer (_Professor Adjunto_) at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (EMAp), Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).
I hold a BSc in Microbiology and Immunology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and a [PhD](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35510) in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom). 

### [Chi son e che faccio](http://www.aria-database.com/search.php?individualAria=36)
Biological processes (such as mutation, selection, development, infection, etc 🧬 🐛 🌱 🦠) are the product of complex interactions between hundreds to hundreds of thousands of dynamic entities. I use Mathematics and Statistics 📊📐 to try and make sense of the data people collect on these processes, hoping to help paint a more complete picture of Nature. 

I teach courses on Statistical Inference ([undergraduate](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Inference_BSc), [graduate](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Inference_MSc)), [Computational Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Computational_Statistics) and [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/BayesianStatisticsCourse). 
See my [CV](https://github.com/maxbiostat/CV/blob/master/cv_LMFCarvalho.pdf) for more information on [papers](https://github.com/maxbiostat/papers) and other academic publications ([Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y2mxpbcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)). A collection of [presentations](https://github.com/maxbiostat/presentations) I have given over the years is also available.

- ⚡ Fun facts: Other than babbling about science, I like football ⚽ (watching and playing), opera 🎼 (watching and annoying others) and grappling 🥋 (watching and [practising](https://www.instagram.com/equipe_dvjj/?hl=en)), in this particular order. Oh, and I’m also a dad and a husband 👶 👩‍❤️‍👨.

### Supervision

If you are a student and would like to work with me, I suggest you browse my [Student Projects](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects) repo and see if anything tickles your curiosity.

### News

- [Guido Moreira](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira) and I have just ArXived a paper on [adaptive truncation of infinite series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06121) with applications to Statistics. It comes with a powerful R package, [**sumR**](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira/sumR). Check it out!
- My paper on log-linear mixtures with [Flavio Coelho](https://cma.fgv.br/professores/flavio-codeco-coelho-0), [Daniel Villela](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=mCE08SEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Leo Bastos](https://lsbastos.github.io/) is now out in _Bayesian Analysis_. [[paper]](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/advance-publication/Bayesian-Inference-for-the-Weights-in-Logarithmic-Pooling/10.1214/22-BA1311.full) [[code]](https://github.com/maxbiostat/opinion_pooling).
- In this very rough [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03216), [Leo Santos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J2_iEs8AAAAJ&hl=en) and colleagues and I look at an exhaustive method for finding all paths between two nodes in a graph. [[code]](https://github.com/gioguarnieri/all_paths/).
