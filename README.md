## Luiz Max Carvalho

Hi there,

I am a Lecturer (_Professor Adjunto_) at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (EMAp), Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).
I hold a BSc in Microbiology and Immunology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and a [PhD](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35510) in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom). 

### Chi son e che faccio[^1]
**Research**: Biological processes (such as mutation, selection, development, infection, etc üß¨ üêõ üå± ü¶†) are the product of complex interactions between hundreds to hundreds of thousands of dynamic entities. I use Mathematics and Statistics üìäüìê to try and make sense of the data people collect on these processes, hoping to help paint a more complete picture of Nature. 
See my [CV](https://github.com/maxbiostat/CV/blob/master/cv_LMFCarvalho.pdf) for more information on [papers](https://github.com/maxbiostat/papers) and other academic publications ([Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y2mxpbcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)).
 A collection of [presentations](https://github.com/maxbiostat/presentations) I have given over the years is also available.  
 
**Teaching**: I teach courses on Statistical Inference ([undergraduate](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Inference_BSc), [graduate](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Inference_MSc)), [Statistical Modelling](https://github.com/maxbiostat/stats_modelling),  [Computational Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Computational_Statistics) and [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/BayesianStatisticsCourse). 


- üì´ Preferred mode of communication is via [email](mailto:lmax.fgv@gmail.com).

- ‚ö° Fun facts: Other than babbling about science, I like football ‚öΩ (watching and playing), opera üéº (watching and annoying others) and grappling ü•ã (watching and practising), in this particular order. Oh, and I‚Äôm also a dad and a husband üë∂üë∂ üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®.

### Supervision

If you are a student and would like to work with me, I suggest you browse my [Student Projects](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects) repo and see if anything tickles your curiosity.

### News
- [Lucas Moschen](https://lucasmoschen.github.io/) and I just arxived a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01271) on a complete statistical treatment of (a particular construction of) the bivariate beta distribution. [[code]](https://github.com/lucasmoschen/bivariate-beta).
- In ["Locking and Quacking: Stacking Bayesian model predictions by log-pooling and superposition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07334) we look at how to use log-linear mixtures to combine predictive densities while bypassing the normalising constant via optimising the Hyvarinen score.
- In this [paper](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/ss_newpaper/SS-2023-0208_na.pdf) now accepted at _Statistica Sinica_, Yueqi Shen, Matt Psioda, Joe Ibrahim and I discuss approaches for setting the (hyper)prior on the discounting factor when performing a normalised power prior analysis. It won the [ENAR](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2023/) Student paper award and the Laplace award at JSM! Congratulations, Yueqi! [[Supplemental Material]](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/preprint/supp/2023-0208_supp.pdf). 
[[preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14230).
- In "[Exploring the Connection Between the Normalized Power Prior and Bayesian Hierarchical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02453)" Yueqi Shen, Matt Psioda, Joe Ibrahim and I look into matching the normalised power prior (NPP) to the Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) in order to make comparable inferences.
- Our paper on looking at tree-focused (i.e. 'topological') diagnostics for MCMC in phylogenetic space is now on out in [Virus Evolution]( https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veae081). [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11657). Joint work with all the usual suspects.
- Our paper on validation for statistical software used in Bayesian phylogenetics has now been accepted at _Systematic Biology_.  [[Preprint]( https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.11.579856)] [[code](https://github.com/rbouckaert/DeveloperManual)].
- Rodrigo Alves, Yuri Saporito and I have ArXived a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17919) on the lumpability of tree-valued Markov processes. This took two years of hard work and I'm glad for it to see the light of day!
- My colleagues from the [Mosqlimate](https://mosqlimate.org/) project (funded by [@wellcometrust](https://wellcome.org/)) have recently ArXived two manuscripts: one on the [Episcanner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21286) framework and the other on the Mosqlimate [data platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18945).
