## Luiz Max Carvalho

Hi there,

My name is Luiz and I am a Lecturer (_Professor Adjunto_) at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (EMAp), Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV).
I hold a BSc in Microbiology and Immunology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and a [PhD](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35510) in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom). 

Biological processes (such as mutation, selection, development, infection, etc 🧬 🐛 🌱 🦠) are the product of complex interactions between hundreds to hundreds of thousands of dynamic entities. I use Mathematics and Statistics 📊📐 to try and make sense of the data people collect on these processes, hoping to help paint a more complete picture of Nature. 

I teach courses in [Statistical Inference](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Inference_BSc), [Computational Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Computational_Statistics) and [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/BayesianStatisticsCourse). 
See my [CV](https://github.com/maxbiostat/CV/blob/master/cv_LMFCarvalho.pdf) for more information on [papers](https://github.com/maxbiostat/papers) and other academic publications ([Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y2mxpbcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)). A collection of some [presentations](https://github.com/maxbiostat/presentations) I have given over the years is also available.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Other than babbling about science, I like football ⚽ (watching and playing), opera 🎼 (watching and annoying others) and judo 🥋 (watching and practising), in this particular order. Oh, and I’m also a dad and a husband 👶 👩‍❤️‍👨.
