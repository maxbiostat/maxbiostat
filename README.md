## Luiz Max Carvalho

Hi there,

I am a Lecturer (_Professor Adjunto_) at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (EMAp), Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).
I hold a BSc in Microbiology and Immunology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and a [PhD](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35510) in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom). 

### Chi son e che faccio[^1]
**Research**: Biological processes (such as mutation, selection, development, infection, etc üß¨ üêõ üå± ü¶†) are the product of complex interactions between hundreds to hundreds of thousands of dynamic entities. I use Mathematics and Statistics üìäüìê to try and make sense of the data people collect on these processes, hoping to help paint a more complete picture of Nature. 
See my [CV](https://github.com/maxbiostat/CV/blob/master/cv_LMFCarvalho.pdf) for more information on [papers](https://github.com/maxbiostat/papers) and other academic publications ([Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y2mxpbcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)).
 A collection of [presentations](https://github.com/maxbiostat/presentations) I have given over the years is also available.  
 
**Teaching**: I teach courses on Statistical Inference ([undergraduate](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Inference_BSc), [graduate](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Statistical_Inference_MSc)), [Statistical Modelling](https://github.com/maxbiostat/stats_modelling),  [Computational Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Computational_Statistics) and [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/maxbiostat/BayesianStatisticsCourse). 



- üì´ Preferred mode of communication is via [email](mailto:lmax.fgv@gmail.com).

- ‚ö° Fun facts: Other than babbling about science, I like football ‚öΩ (watching and playing), opera üéº (watching and annoying others) and grappling ü•ã (watching and practising), in this particular order. Oh, and I‚Äôm also a dad and a husband üë∂üë∂ üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®.

### Supervision

If you are a student and would like to work with me, I suggest you browse my [Student Projects](https://github.com/maxbiostat/Student_projects) repo and see if anything tickles your curiosity.

### News

- [Guido Moreira](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira) and I have just ArXived a paper on [adaptive truncation of infinite series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06121) with applications to Statistics. It comes with a powerful R package, [**sumR**](https://github.com/GuidoAMoreira/sumR). Check it out!
- My paper on log-linear mixtures with [Flavio Coelho](https://cma.fgv.br/professores/flavio-codeco-coelho-0), [Daniel Villela](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=mCE08SEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Leo Bastos](https://lsbastos.github.io/) is now out in _Bayesian Analysis_. [[paper]](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/advance-publication/Bayesian-Inference-for-the-Weights-in-Logarithmic-Pooling/10.1214/22-BA1311.full) [[code]](https://github.com/maxbiostat/opinion_pooling).
- [Lucas Moschen](https://lucasmoschen.github.io/) and I just arxived a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01271) on a complete statistical treatment of (a particular construction of) the bivariate beta distribution. [[code]](https://github.com/lucasmoschen/bivariate-beta).
- @adamesalles [just got](https://impa.br/noticias/inctmat-divulga-lista-de-contemplados-com-bolsas-de-iniciacao-cientifica/) a nice scientific initiation scholarship from  INCTMat to work on [shape-constrained GPs](https://github.com/adamesalles/gp-visual-tool). Congratulations, Adame!
- Collegues from Auckland and I just (bio)arxived a paper on validation for statistical software used in Bayesian phylogenetics. [[paper]( https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.11.579856)] [[code](https://github.com/rbouckaert/DeveloperManual)].
-  Our preprint on looking at tree-focused (i.e. 'topological') diagnostics for MCMC in phylogenetic space is now on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11657). Joint work with all the usual suspects.
- In ["Locking and Quacking: Stacking Bayesian model predictions by log-pooling and superposition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07334) we look at how to use log-linear mixtures to combine predictive densities while bypassing the normalising constant via optimising the Hyvarinen score.
- In this [paper](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/ss_newpaper/SS-2023-0208_na.pdf) now accepted at _Statistica Sinica_, Yueqi Shen, Matt Psioda, Joe Ibrahim and I discuss approaches for setting the (hyper)prior on the discounting factor when performing a normalised power prior analysis. It won the [ENAR](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2023/) Student paper award and the Laplace award at JSM! Congratulations, Yueqi! [[preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14230).
